# There is only one character 'A' on the screen of a notepad. You can perform one of two operations on this notepad for each step:

# Copy All: You can copy all the characters present on the screen (a partial copy is not allowed).
# Paste: You can paste the characters which are copied last time.
# Given an integer n, return the minimum number of operations to get the character 'A' exactly n times on the screen.
