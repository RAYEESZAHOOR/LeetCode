# Number Complement
# Easy

# The complement of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the 0's to 1's and all the 1's to 0's in its binary representation.

# For example, The integer 5 is "101" in binary and its complement is "010" which is the integer 2.
# Given an integer num, return its complement.



class Solution:
    def findComplement(self, num: int) -> int:
        bit_length = num.bit_length()
        
        mask = (1 << bit_length) - 1
        
        return num ^ mask
